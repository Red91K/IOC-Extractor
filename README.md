# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and navigate inside it.
```
git clone https://github.com/Red91K/IOC-Extractor.git
cd IOC-Extractor
```
2. Create two directories titled `Extracted` and `Sources` respectively.
```
mkdir Extracted
mkdir Sources
```


# Running the Tool
```
python3 Extractor.py  
```
- Follow the directions displayed by the script:
  - First import sources either from a URL or a file within the Sources directory. Give each source a descriptive name.
  - Wait for the script to finish extracting the IOCs
  - Choose an export method! Extractor currently supports plain text, markdown, json, and STIX 2.1
  - Get your extracted IOCs! Exported IOCs can be found as files in the `Extracted` directory, and will also be automatically copied to clipboard and displayed by the script. 
- You can customise things like detection sensitivity, types of IOCs to search for, and whether or not to fang exported indicators by editing the config.json file.
